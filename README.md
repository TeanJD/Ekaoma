Eli kyseessä ensimmäinen osa, kolmiosaisesta sovelluksesta joka on suunniteltu projektien vaiheiden kommunikoimiseen minulta sen toteuttajalle fiverrissa
Tässä ensimmäisessä osassa me luomme sovelluksen joka tekee toivomallani tavalla pdfn, toisessa jpg, kolmannessa word tiedoston

eka teksti "Hi! I'm looking to gain coding skills, particularly in Python for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. Can you guide me through building this app step by step? If I share the details, I'd also appreciate help integrating HTML and CSS. Thank you!"


## H2 To start building the PDF generator project on GitHub, you can follow these steps:

1. **Project Planning**: Begin by outlining the project structure, including the frontend and backend components, as well as the integration of the OpenAI API for advanced language processing.

2. **Create Repository**: On GitHub, create a new repository for your PDF generator project. This will serve as the central location for storing and managing your project files.

3. **Initial Setup**: Set up the basic project structure including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend, and any necessary backend files.

4. **Frontend Development**: Begin by creating the user interface (UI) elements outlined in the provided document, such as the title bar, input box, output boxes, editing options menu, additional input field, and download button. You can use HTML and CSS to create these elements based on the provided UI descriptions.

5. **Backend Integration**: Integrate the backend components, such as setting up API endpoints for OpenAI integration and implementing functionality for saving drafts, handling negative prompts, and generating PDFs.

6. **OpenAI API Integration**: Follow the provided guidelines to integrate the OpenAI API for grammar correction, wording enhancement, and creative reframing. This involves setting up API keys, creating endpoints, handling requests, and integrating API responses into the backend logic.

7. **Styling and Fonts**: Implement consistent font usage and sizes as described in the document to enhance the visual appeal of the application.

8. **Testing and Optimization**: Rigorously test the application under various scenarios to ensure reliability and optimize performance as needed.

9. **Documentation**: Document the project structure, codebase, and integration processes to provide comprehensive guidance for future developers or contributors.

10. **Version Control**: Utilize Git for version control to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage the project's codebase effectively.

Remember to refer to the specific sections of the provided document for detailed guidelines and best practices throughout the development process.
